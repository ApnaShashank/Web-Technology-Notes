- What is HTML (HyperText Markup Language)?
- HTML is the language for publishing web pages on the WWW (World-Wide Web, or World-Wide Wait?).
- HTML is a Document Description Language (aka Document Markup Language). HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML is NOT a programming language like C/C++/C#/Java, which is used to implement programming algorithm.
- An HTML document is a text document, and it is human-readable.
- Today, HTML works together with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) (for layout) and JavaScript (for programming).

- Advantages of HTML
- HTML helps to build structure of a website and is a widely used Markup language.
- It is easy to learn.
- Every browser supports HTML Language.
- HTML is light weighted and fast to load.
- Storage of big files are allowed because of the application cache feature.

- It is fast to download as the text is compressible.
- Very useful for beginners in the web designing field.
- HTML can be supported to each and every browser, if not supported to all the browsers.
- HTML is built on almost every website, if not all websites.
- HTML is increasingly used for data storage as like XML syntax.
- HTML has many tag and attributes which can short your line of code.

- Advantages of Front-end development

Enhanced User Experience: Well-designed front-end interfaces create an intuitive and user-friendly experience. A smooth and visually appealing user interface (UI) can lead to higher user satisfaction and engagement.

Responsiveness: Front-end developers ensure that websites and applications are responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This flexibility is crucial in the age of mobile browsing.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Skilled front-end developers make sure that websites work consistently across various web browsers, reducing compatibility issues.

- Scalability: Modular and component-based front-end development allows for easier scalability and future expansion of the website or application.
- Security: Implementing secure coding practices on the front end can help protect against common security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Real-time Interaction: Front-end technologies enable real-time interaction through features like chat systems, notifications, and dynamic content updates without requiring a full page refresh.

Advantages of CSS

- 1. Separation of Content and Presentation:
One of the key principles of CSS is the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update web content without affecting its structure.
- 2. Consistency:
CSS allows you to define a consistent look and feel for an entire website. You can create a single style sheet and apply it to multiple web pages, ensuring a uniform design.
- 3. Responsive Design:
CSS enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS make it possible to adjust layouts and styles based on factors like screen width.

    <section>
        <h2>Page 12</h2>
        <pre>
- Improved Page Loading Speed:

By keeping presentation details in external CSS files, web pages load faster because browsers can cache these styles. This reduces the need to re-download the same style information for each page.
5. Accessibility:

CSS can be used to improve web accessibility. It allows for the creation of well-structured documents that can be easily read by screen readers and other assistive technologies.
6. Flexible Layouts:

CSS provides a wide range of layout options, including grid systems, flexboxes, and CSS frameworks. This flexibility allows for the creation of complex and responsive page layouts.

- Advantages of Back end
- 1. Data Management: Back-end development allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. This is essential for handling user information, content, and application data.
- 2. Security: Back-end developers can implement security measures to protect user data and sensitive information. This includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- 3. Scalability: Back-end systems can be designed to handle increased loads and traffic. As an application grows, back-end developers can optimize server infrastructure and databases to accommodate higher demand.
